        Wing foil (or wing surf), which appeared on our spots in 2019, is one of
        the most popular water sports disciplines. A hybrid between surfing,
        kitesurfing, SUP, and windsurfing, it brings together the best of these
        board sports in a practice that is both accessible, fun, and innovative.

          What is wing foil?

          Wingfoil is a water sport that combines a board, a hydrofoil placed
          under the hull, and an inflatable wing to hold directly in your hands
          using handles or a boom. Unlike kitesurfing or windsurfing, here there
          are no lines or rigid masts holding the sail. With maximum freedom and
          an incredible sensation of flying above the water, it’s a board sport
          accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        <p
          className="text-[16px] leading-[24px] text-[#333] mb-4"
          style={{ fontFamily: '"alliance no.2", sans-serif, serif' }}
        >
          The foil, attached under the board via a box (often double US box),
          allows the rider to lift off as soon as a certain speed is reached. From
          then on, you glide above the water’s surface with smooth and silent
          motion. Even with relatively light wind, you can fly: a real revolution
          for sailing sports enthusiasts frustrated by weak wind!
        </p>
        <p
          className="text-[16px] leading-[24px] text-[#333]"
          style={{ fontFamily: '"alliance no.2", sans-serif, serif' }}
        >
          This gliding activity has recently exploded with the arrival of easier,
          lighter, and more forgiving equipment. The foil mast is made of aluminum
          or carbon, the increasingly high-performance wings are rigid and made of
          carbon, and the boards are designed to make progression easier, shaped
          according to the chosen program (beginner, freeride, freestyle, slalom).
          As for the wings, they are generally made of 2 inflatable bladders (the
          smaller one being the central strut and the larger one the leading edge).

      {/* Question 2 */}

          Why are so many people taking up wing foil?
        </h3>

          className="text-[16px] leading-[24px] text-[#333] mb-4"

        >
          Because it’s super fun, less physical than windsurfing, less dangerous
          than kiting, and you can ride in almost any weather. Wingfoil allows you
          to fly from around ten knots of wind. It can be practiced at sea, on
          lakes, or even on ponds. All you need is a bit of water with a minimum
          depth of 1.50 m, a bit of wind, and you’re good to go.
        </p>
        <p
          className="text-[16px] leading-[24px] text-[#333] mb-4"
          style={{ fontFamily: '"alliance no.2", sans-serif, serif' }}
        >
          It’s also a sport with fewer logistical constraints, hence its success:
          the equipment is more compact than a windsurf quiver, and you don’t need
          much space to set it up like with kite foiling. You can pack your gear
          into specific bags, slip it into your trunk, and head out for your
          sessions on the water in no time.
        </p>

          style={{ fontFamily: '"alliance no.2", sans-serif, serif' }}
        >
          And above all: the gliding sensation is magical! For many riders coming
          from kiting, surfing, windsurfing, or stand-up paddling, it’s a new
          passion.

          Kite foil: faster, more technical, but dependent on steady wind and
          large water areas. More difficult to learn. You need a solid kitesurfing
          background to start.

          Wingfoil: compact, lightweight, easy to transport, and quick to progress.
          Suitable for both beginners and experienced board riders. The wing is
          also safer: less power, no accidental jumps, and the ability to let go
          of the wing in case of a fall without continuing to be pulled. A real
          plus for those who want to ride and progress without fear.

          For beginners, choose a foil board with good volume (at least 30 or even
          40 liters above your weight). The wider it is, the more stable. A longer
          board glides better on the water, making takeoff easier and faster.
          Beginners are advised to go for a board that’s long and wide enough to
          make their first sessions easier. On the other hand, a shorter board
          offers better responsiveness and allows tighter turns but requires more
          technical mastery.

          Inflatable boards, light and less fragile, are ideal for beginners thanks
          to their easy transport and safer design (less risk of injury on impact).
          However, they offer reduced stability as they react strongly to your
          movements, which may slightly slow your progress. Also, because they’re
          lightweight, these boards tend to flip foil-up when you fall, so be
          careful to avoid damaging your wing!
        </p>

          Rigid boards stand out for their stability, more pronounced
          responsiveness, and superior performance. These advantages allow you to
          progress faster in wingfoil, making learning more motivating and
          effective.

            a fuselage: often aluminum or carbon. Beginners should go for a longer

          </li>
          <li>
            a front wing: with a large surface area to make lift easier, especially
            for beginners (between 1500 and 1800 cm² depending on your weight). A
            thicker front wing is also recommended for beginners.

            a mounting plate on most foils: this is the part that connects the board
